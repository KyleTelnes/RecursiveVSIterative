## About
This project was created for a school assignment, to compare the speed of an Iterative implementation of a power 
function against a Recursive implementation. The results from my computer are in a CSV file in the recursiveVSiterative
directory called recursiveVSiterativeData.csv

## How to run the program

Clone the repository to your computer, make sure that the latest version of Java is installed on your computer.
- You can open Visual Studio Code to run the code, this project was created in VS Code meaning it should work
- Alternatively, you could open a command line and do the following:
1. Navigate to the src directory (JavaProject > recursiveVSiterative > src)
2. Type "java recursiveVSiterative.java" and press enter
